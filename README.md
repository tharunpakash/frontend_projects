# Nostra E-Commerce (Frontend Project)

This is my **first frontend project**, built to learn the fundamentals of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project is a simple **E-commerce website UI** where I explored responsive layouts, navigation, and basic interactivity.

In the future, I plan to **refactor and scale this project** using **React** and **Tailwind CSS** to make it more component-based, maintainable, and professional.
